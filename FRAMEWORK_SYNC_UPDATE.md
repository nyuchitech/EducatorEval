# Framework Synchronization: 10 Look-Fors Integration

## Issue Resolved

The observe page had 10 comprehensive look-fors, but the framework configuration page only showed 3, creating an inconsistency between the observation system and the framework management system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Framework Configurator (`FrameworkConfigurator.tsx`)

**Added 7 Missing Look-Fors:**

4. **Questioning Strategies**: Teacher uses questioning strategies that increase cognitive demand and promote student thinking.
   - **Alignments**: 5 Daily Assessment, CRP (High Expectations), Tripod: Challenge

5. **Collaborative Learning**: Students are engaged in meaningful, collaborative learning experiences with clear roles and expectations.
   - **Alignments**: CRP (General), CASEL (Relationship Skills), Tripod: Captivate & Control, Inclusive Practices

6. **Cultural Competence**: Teacher demonstrates cultural competence and integrates students' backgrounds and experiences into the lesson.
   - **Alignments**: CRP (Learning Partnerships), Panorama, CASEL (Social Awareness), Tripod: Confer

7. **Active Monitoring**: Teacher actively monitors and supports students during group and independent work.
   - **Alignments**: 5 Daily Assessment, Tripod: Control, Inclusive Practices

8. **Reflection & Consolidation**: Students have opportunities to reflect on and consolidate their learning during and after the lesson.
   - **Alignments**: 5 Daily Assessment, CASEL (Self-Management), Tripod: Consolidate

9. **Relationship Building**: Teacher builds strong, trusting relationships with students through affirming interactions.
   - **Alignments**: Panorama, CRP (General), CASEL (Relationship Skills), Tripod: Care

10. **Differentiated Instruction**: Instruction is differentiated and scaffolds support access for diverse learning needs.
    - **Alignments**: Inclusive Practices, CRP (General), CASEL (Equity & Access), Tripod: Clarify

### 2. Mobile Observation Form (`MobileObservationForm.tsx`)

**Standardized Framework Alignments:**
- Converted inconsistent `frameworks` string properties to structured `frameworkAlignments` arrays
- Updated framework display to use structured framework options with color-coded badges
- Ensured consistency between observation form and framework configurator

### 3. Framework Options Enhancement

**Added Missing Framework:**
- `casel-equity-access`: CASEL (Equity & Access) for comprehensive CASEL coverage

## Impact

### ✅ Consistency Achieved
- Framework configurator now matches the complete 10 look-fors observation system
- All look-fors have proper framework alignments and detailed descriptions
- Standardized data structure across both systems

### ✅ Enhanced Framework Management
- Framework editors can now see and modify all 10 look-fors
- Proper framework alignment visualization with color-coded badges  
- Comprehensive help text and tags for each look-for

### ✅ Complete Integration
- Observation form and framework configurator are fully synchronized
- Framework alignments properly mapped to research-based practices
- Ready for advanced analytics and reporting on framework alignment

### ✅ Production Ready
- All TypeScript errors resolved
- Successful build with all 7 pages
- Consistent user experience across observation and framework management

The CRP Observation System now provides a complete, synchronized experience where the 10 look-fors are consistently represented across both the observation tools and the framework management system.
