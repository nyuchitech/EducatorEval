## Implementation Details

### Files Added/Modified
- âœ… `src/components/ProfilePage.tsx` - Main profile management component
- âœ… `src/components/UserMenu.tsx` - Header dropdown menu
- âœ… `src/components/Layout.tsx` - Enhanced layout with user menu
- âœ… `src/components/ObservationsList.tsx` - Observations management page
- âœ… `src/pages/profile.astro` - Profile page route
- âœ… `src/hooks/useAuth.ts` - Extended with profile methods
- âœ… `src/hooks/useObservations.ts` - Added search/filter methods

### Security Considerations
- âœ… Role switching requires permission validation
- âœ… Profile updates require authentication
- âœ… Secure logout functionality
- âœ… Session management controls
- âœ… Input validation and error handling

## Usage Examples
